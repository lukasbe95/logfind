The logfind tool should have these basic features:
	1. This tool takes any sequence of words and assumes I mean “and” for
	them. So logfind zedshaw smart guy will find all files that have
	zedshaw and smart and guy in them.
	2. It takes an optional argument of -o if the parameters are meant to be or
	logic.
	3. It loads the list of allowed log files from ~/.logfind.
	4. The list of file names can be anything that the glob function allows.
	Refer to man 3 glob to see how this works. I suggest starting with just a
	flat list of exact files, and then add glob functionality.
	5. You should output the matching lines as you scan, and try to match them
	as fast as possible.

-- TODO ---------
1. Find directories where .log are stored
2. When program runs it checks if ~/.logfind exists. If not create it. -> DONE
3. Implement cli arguments parser -> FIRST TASK
4. Implement function which can open all files in specified dir and print it to the screen.
5. Implement find operation (simple, without AND, OR operations)
6. Upgrade find with AND, OR operations.
